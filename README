= Freebase
This Ruby-on-Rails plugin provides access to the Freebase API (http://www.freebase.com). Freebase is a collaborative, semantic database similar to Wikipedia only for structured data. Freebase.com provides a JSON-over-HTTP API that this library uses.

Currently only reads are implemented. Contributions, API Suggestions, bug reports are welcome!

This code is ALPHA. The API will change, features will be added. It probably has a bug or two in it. Use it at your own peril.
